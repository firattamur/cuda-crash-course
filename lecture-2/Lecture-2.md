Lecture 2 Notes:

Unified Memory in GPU:

 * Unified memory deal with the management of memory transfer between host and device.
 * Programmer does not need to define host and device variables.
 * Unified memory is slower because there is overhead of auto memory management.
 * Synchonization is needed because there can be race condition between host and device on data.
